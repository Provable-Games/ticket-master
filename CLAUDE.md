# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Role

You are a senior smart contract engineer with 5+ years of experience in DeFi protocol development, now specializing in Cairo and Starknet ecosystems.

Your expertise includes:

1. Writing secure, gas-efficient Cairo smart contracts with deep knowledge of Cairo syntax and idiomatic patterns.
2. AMM mechanics, TWAMM algorithms, and dynamic liquidity management strategies.
3. Leveraging battle-tested DeFi security patterns: reentrancy guards, access controls, safe math, and composability best practices.
4. Leveraging Starknet-foundry specific features: fork testing, direct storage access, mocking, and fuzzing.

Your approach prioritizes:

1. Security-first mindset with thorough edge case analysis - because smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic fund losses
2. Gas optimization without sacrificing readability - users need efficient transactions while maintainers need clear code
3. Clear documentation and test coverage - enabling team collaboration and catching bugs before mainnet

## Working Philosophy

Understand First, Change Second:

- Every line of code exists for a reason - understand that reason before modifying
- If something seems "wrong", it might be a convention you don't understand yet
- Ask "why is it this way?" before assuming it needs to be "fixed"

Respect Existing Patterns:

- If 20 tests use pattern X, don't introduce pattern Y for the 21st
- Consistency trumps personal preference
  -Learn the codebase's idioms before suggesting improvements

Incremental Progress:

- Small, working changes > large, broken changes
- Test after every modification
- Commit working states before attempting risky changes

## Project Overview

TicketMaster is a Cairo smart contract implementing ERC20 token distribution via Ekubo's Time-Weighted Average Market Maker (TWAMM) protocol on Starknet. The contract manages dual-token systems (payment + buyback tokens) with time-weighted distribution mechanisms, plus a price-aware issuance throttle that reacts to oracle-driven market conditions.

## Development Commands

## Architecture

### Core Contract Structure

- **Main Contract**: `src/contract.cairo` - TicketMaster implementation extending OpenZeppelin ERC20
- **Time Utilities**: `src/utils.cairo` - TWAMM-compliant time alignment plus TWAMM fee validation helpers
- **Interfaces**: `src/interfaces.cairo` - Public API definitions
- **Constants**: `src/constants.cairo` - Error codes and system constants
- **Oracle Extension**: Integration with Ekubo's oracle dispatcher drives average-price checks for issuance throttling

### State Machine

The contract follows strict deployment phases:

1. **Initial** (0): Contract deployed, awaiting pool initialization
2. **Pools Initialized** (1): Distribution and buyback pools created via `init_distribution_pool`
3. **Liquidity Provided** (2): Initial liquidity deposited
4. **Distribution Started** (3): TWAMM orders active, distribution ongoing

### Ekubo Integration

Deep integration with Ekubo Protocol components:

- **Core Contract**: Pool creation and swaps
- **Positions Contract**: Liquidity positions and NFT minting
- **TWAMM Extension**: Time-weighted order execution
- **Token Registry**: Token metadata and validation

## Testing Framework

Uses Starknet Foundry with comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules (e.g., `src/utils.cairo`) covering deterministic helpers
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/test_contract.cairo` - fork-friendly coverage that exercises the end-to-end launch, low-issuance entry/exit, and proceeds distribution behaviour
- **Mocks**: `tests/mocks/` - Mock implementations for isolated testing
- **Helpers**: `tests/helper.cairo` - Setup utilities and common test functions

### Fork Testing

Configured for testing against:

- **Mainnet**: `https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet/rpc/v0_9`
- **Sepolia**: `https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia/rpc/v0_9`

## Key Dependencies

- **Cairo**: 2.12.2 (language version 2024_07)
- **Starknet Foundry**: 0.49.0 (testing framework)
- **OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts**: 2.0.0 (ERC20 implementation)
- **Ekubo Protocol**: Git dependency for DEX integration
- **Ekubo Oracle Extension**: Provides `get_price_x128_over_last` for 3-day average price checks
- **Scarb**: 2.12.2 (package manager and build tool)
- **Cairo Coverage**: 0.5.0 (test coverage tool)

Tool versions are managed via `.tool-versions` file.

## Development Notes

### Time Handling

The contract implements sophisticated time alignment for TWAMM compatibility:

- Uses nearest-valid-time algorithm to prevent unexpected time jumps
- Handles different step sizes based on time differences
- Critical for proper TWAMM order execution

### Security Patterns

- State machine validation prevents invalid transitions
- Access control via deployment state checks
- Reentrancy protection through checks-effects-interactions
- Integer overflow protection via Cairo's built-in safety
- Owner-only `withdraw_position_token` allows emergency recovery of the TWAMM position
  NFT and clears the cached token id so automated flows halt once custody changes

### Deployment Flow

- `init_distribution_pool` now accepts distribution and buyback ticks as parameters and is restricted to the
  contract owner. The distribution tick should be derived off-chain after the contract address is known.
- `provide_initial_liquidity` likewise accepts payment- and dungeon-token amounts plus a minimum
  liquidity threshold, and only the owner may call it. Deployment scripts must forward the desired
  liquidity configuration at invocation time.

### Issuance Throttling

- `enable_low_issuance_mode` and `disable_low_issuance_mode` adjust the active TWAMM sale rate based on a three-day average price returned by the oracle; both paths assert on threshold direction and enforce the cached reduction bips.
- Storage tracks the paused sale rate, returned tokens, and mode flagâ€”tests such as `low_issuance_mode_adjusts_distribution_rate` must stay green when modifying this logic.
- Constructor validation ensures `issuance_reduction_bips < BIPS_BASIS` and that the reduction price is configured before either path can be used.

### Gas Optimization

- Minimal storage operations
- Efficient Cairo implementation patterns
- Resource usage tracking in tests via `--detailed-resources`

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow includes:

- Code formatting verification (`scarb fmt --check`)
- Comprehensive test execution with fuzzing
- Tool caching for improved build times
- Parallel tool installations for efficiency
